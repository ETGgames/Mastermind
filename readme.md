This is the game that is implemented: http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf

Run project with make from a terminal:

make clean  
make all  
make run  

a sensible input length would be 4 and possible values 5, so type 4 and then 5 to cin.
However, the algorithm changes according to how big these values are so it doesn't take too much time (hopefully)
